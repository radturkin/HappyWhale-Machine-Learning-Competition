# HappyWhale-Machine-Learning-Competition
A Machine Learning competition via Kaggle, a team project

This project was the sole effort of my partner Brian Salamone in Argentina and myself. The above file remains unchanged from its final working version. It is a living document consisting of notes on the project and between the two of us, ideas, questions, and other comments as we attempted to created a more accurate machine learning model.

The competition itself was to create a ML model that could identity individual whales and dolphins exclusively using images of their fins.
The training data consisted of a total of 51033 images of more than 15,000 individual whales and dolphins.
The test data consisted of a total of 27956 images.

Using a smaller data set we were able to create a model of relatively high accuracy. Though when fed the full data set, our model failed to run within the given time constraints of 9 hours required for the competition, and timed out. Other challenges included frequently running out of TPU hours, necessary for a speedier model. We have since moved on from this project and have begun to work on a new ML competition, hoping to learn from our previous mistakes with a focus on a faster, slimmed down, and more time managed model.
